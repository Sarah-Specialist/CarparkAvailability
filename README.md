## Introduction

This is my individual project for the SkillsUnion/NTU Software Developer Immersive course. I have created a website used to check for parking lot availability in a specific carpark. This tool helps the general public to easily find and source for available parking. The Carpark Availability tool features all the following:
- Axios
- Real carpark data from data.gov.sg API
- Using real-time information.
